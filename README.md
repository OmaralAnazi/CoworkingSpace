# Coworking Space Directory

## Description
The "Coworking Space" project, a guided exercise in the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program, showcases various coworking spaces suitable for developers. It emphasizes the use of CSS positioning techniques to create a well-structured and visually coherent layout.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS

## Learnings
- Applied `margin: auto` on flex children to center elements within a flex container.
- Utilized CSS positioning, including `absolute`, `relative`, and `fixed`, to layer and place elements effectively.
- Employed `align-self` to individually align flex items perpendicularly to the flex direction.

## Setup
To explore different coworking options, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
